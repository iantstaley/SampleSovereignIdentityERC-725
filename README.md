# SampleSovereignIdentityERC-725
An example code for creating a new sovereign identity on the Ethereum network using ERC-725.
Creating sovereign identities on the Ethereum network can be done through the use of smart contracts. One popular protocol for creating these identities is called ERC-725.
This contract includes functions for adding and removing keys, as well as executing operations using a recovery key. Each sovereign identity is represented by an Identity struct which contains a mapping of key-value pairs, an address for the recovery key, an array of keys, and a nonce to prevent replay attacks.

To create a new sovereign identity, you can deploy this smart contract to the Ethereum network and then call the addKey function with a unique identifier for the identity (e.g. a name or public key) and any additional data you would like to include. Once a key has been added, it can be used to execute operations on the contract using the execute function.

It is important to note that this is just an example implementation, and you may want to customize the contract to fit your specific use case.
